# Inter-Process Communication Debugger

A debugging tool for inter-process communication (IPC) methods such as pipes, message queues, and shared memory. This tool helps developers identify synchronization issues, data sharing problems, and potential bottlenecks or deadlocks in their applications. It includes a simple GUI to simulate and monitor IPC operations.

## Features

- **Visualize Data Transfer**: Monitor data flow through named pipes.
- **Message Queue Monitoring**: Track messages in Python's `multiprocessing.Queue`.
- **Shared Memory Access**: Visualize and debug shared memory usage.
- **Deadlock Detection**: Simulate and identify deadlocks using thread locks and semaphores.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter to provide an intuitive interface for simulating and debugging IPC mechanisms.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Entry point for the application.
- **`ipc_debugger/`**: Core module containing the following components:
  - **`__init__.py`**: Package initialization.
  - **`gui.py`**: GUI implementation using Tkinter.
  - **`pipe_debug.py`**: Debugging functionality for named pipes.
  - **`queue_debug.py`**: Debugging functionality for message queues.
  - **`shared_mem_debug.py`**: Debugging functionality for shared memory.
  - **`deadlock_detector.py`**: Deadlock simulation and detection logic.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Tkinter**: Included in the standard Python library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Inter-Process-Communication-Debugger.git
   cd Inter-Process-Communication-Debugger
   ```

2. Install any additional dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Implementation Details

The application demonstrates IPC mechanisms using the following approaches:

- **Named Pipes**: For pipe communication.
- **Message Queues**: Using Python's `multiprocessing.Queue`.
- **Shared Memory**: Visualized using Python's `multiprocessing.shared_memory`.
- **Deadlock Simulation**: Implemented with thread locks and semaphores.
